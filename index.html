              <p>
                The story of risotto is a tale deeply rooted in the culinary
                traditions of northern Italy, particularly in the regions of
                Lombardy and Piedmont. Its origins can be traced back to as
                early as the 11th century, when rice cultivation was introduced
                to Italy by the Moors. Initially, rice was considered a luxury
                ingredient and was often used in dishes served to aristocrats.
                Over time, as rice became more widely cultivated in the Po
                Valley, it became a staple food for the local population.
              </p>

                People love risotto for its creamy texture, flavor versatility,
                cultural significance, creative potential, and its ability to

          <ul class="risotto-steps-list">
            <li>
              Choose the right rice: Opt for Arborio or Carnaroli rice, known
              for their high starch content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Saut√© aromatics: Begin by saut√©ing finely chopped onions or
              shallots in butter or olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Toast the rice: Add the rice and toast it for a minute until
              coated in fat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Deglaze with wine: Pour in white wine and stir until mostly
              absorbed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gradual broth addition: Add hot broth one ladleful at a time,
              stirring constantly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Slow, gentle cooking: Keep adding broth and stirring for about
              18-20 minutes until rice is al dente.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creamy finish: Remove from heat, stir in grated Parmesan cheese
              and butter, and season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Rest briefly: Allow it to rest for a minute before serving.</li>
            <li>
              Garnish and enjoy: Add fresh herbs or additional cheese for extra
              flavor, then serve your perfect risotto.
            </li>
