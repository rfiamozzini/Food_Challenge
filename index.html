            <p class="card-text">
              The story of risotto is a rich tapestry woven through the culinary
              history of Italy. Its origins can be traced back to the north of
              Italy, particularly Lombardy and Piedmont, where the cool climate
              and abundant water supply made it ideal for rice cultivation.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              Initially, rice was considered a luxury item brought to Italy by
              Arab traders during the Middle Ages. It gained popularity among
              the Italian aristocracy and evolved into the creamy, comforting
              dish we know today. The first recorded risotto recipe, known as
              "risotto alla Milanese," emerged in the 18th century and featured
              saffron as a key ingredient.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              Over time, this dish became a canvas for creativity, with
              countless regional variations showcasing the diversity of Italian
              cuisine. Today, risotto remains a symbol of Italian gastronomy,
              celebrated worldwide for its creamy texture and ability to capture
              the essence of a wide array of flavors.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              People love risotto for its creamy texture, flavor versatility,
              cultural significance, creative potential, and its ability to
              bring people together around the table. It's a dish that offers
              both comfort and culinary adventure, making it a cherished
              favorite for many.

        <ul class="container-list">
          <li>
            Choose the right rice: Opt for Arborio or Carnaroli rice, known for
            their high starch content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Saut√© aromatics: Begin by saut√©ing finely chopped onions or shallots
            in butter or olive oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Toast the rice: Add the rice and toast it for a minute until coated
            in fat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deglaze with wine: Pour in white wine and stir until mostly
            absorbed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gradual broth addition: Add hot broth one ladleful at a time,
            stirring constantly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slow, gentle cooking: Keep adding broth and stirring for about 18-20
            minutes until rice is al dente.
          </li>
          <li>
            Creamy finish: Remove from heat, stir in grated Parmesan cheese and
            butter, and season with salt and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>Rest briefly: Allow it to rest for a minute before serving.</li>
